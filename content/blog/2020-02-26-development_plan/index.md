title: This site's development plan

Here is the roadmap for my own website. Now, this website will always be under construction, that's the nature of web development. No website will ever be "finished". You cannot finish a website like you finish a house.

In the coming days and weeks, however, there will be plans to make this a more functional website besides it being a blog.

What I will not plan to do on this site, however, is for you to comment on my posts. I do not plan to have any frequent readers on this site, so I do not plan to have any commenting planned. If you have any questions about this site you are free to DM me on my Twitter feed. Business inquiries should go directly to my <A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/echu916" target=_blank>LinkedIn profile</A>.

This site was started on February 25, 2020.

From now until March:
- Configuring, deploying this site to add more social media interactions

April:
- Other enhancements, like a static banner on top of page 
- Having set topics of discussion

May:
- Generally speaking, May is probably the time when I expect edchu.dev to be a fully functional website. But blog posts will continue to be made.

On the horizon:
- Dark mode
- Use Twitter to engage what I post
(that means you will read them here and engage with comments and such on Twitter, not here on my website.)
- Have a look at some open source work I contributed
