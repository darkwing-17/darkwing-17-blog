As I continue to get this blog up and running - and make it readily accessible and social media friendly - I will begin by making the purpose for what this blog is about.

I plan to carry most of my postings here that I would have posted on Facebook or IG, with the only difference being that it would be here.

Having it on my own blogroll here allows me considerable freedom to use what content I want to use. The power of Gatsby also allows readers to visit this site in a presentable form on any device they choose.

For the tech minded, this website will also serve as an eventual staging point for any future contributions I would make to any open source project being put out of by the Git community. 

Gatsby.js allows me to do this. It is driven by the React framework. Gatsby is what's known as a static site generator application, which outputs a static website. SSGs like Gatsby can output a static site that can be viewed easily on any device, desktop or mobile, and can be scaled easily for a more dynamic application (i.e. online shops). I chose Gatsby due largely to my relatively young experience with the React framework, for what Gatsby is based.

As I navigate and explore more of how Gatsby will do, this will also serve to be a place where I will be able to show my folio as well (it is currently hosted on https://echu916.myportfolio.com, which is hosted on Adobe's end and it eventually will make its way here in the coming weeks.)

Finally, the title <strong>"Because I have no time for games"</strong> does not mean I have time to PLAY video or board games. It simply means <strong>I'm tired of being played.</strong>
