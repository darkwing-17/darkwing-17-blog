## A time to adjust to a new reality

April was a month where I decided to do some real assessment of what I really want in my next job. After fruitless job searches and an increased need to build a skillset, I decided to take a break from job hunting until I have built some kind of skillset that I will be able to use outside BD authoring.

As I have found, a certificate in web development does not really mean anything. A portfolio matters, and I do not have that kind of a portfolio that would impress anyone. All I can show off is this blog, which isn't going to do much. 

I have to show more than just this.

## Game development beginnings

In the past weeks, I took online courses offered by Epic Games for their Unreal Engine and Unity Technologies for their Unity game engine. Last week (as I type) I took Unreal courses almost every day, two hours per day, though admittedly, the Unreal Engine training courses do not offer a consistency that I wanted. I took their introduction course (which I paid a hundred dollars for) back in late October, and it lasted one WHOLE day - not two hours - that got me really up to speed with the Unreal Engine world. The virtual training courses that Epic Games had this month did some help, but I honestly feel that I would have to take a day's worth of courses to learn how to use Unreal effectively. 

Unity offered a course track that I started to follow that was every hour each day. I found Unity's courses to be a lot easier to digest and allowed me to get up to speed with my programming skills, even though they were specifically designed for those who are almost new to programming. Unity's game engine uses C#, which is similar to Java, but it is a Microsoft developed programming language and architecture. The one thing that I really like about Unity is that its hardware requirements are not as high as Unreal Engine and it shows.

I learned a lot more from Unity with their game engine, though I cannot say that I didn't learn anything from Epic's Unreal training courses. I feel that there were not a lot of programming topics covered in the Unreal virtual training courses compared to the Unity course track, and maybe that's because the Unity course track I took was "Create with Code"? Also, I got exposed to a new language: C#, which is similar to Java, but it is Microsoft's language.

The Unity course track also had a project that people can work on, without a set deadline. But they did offer discounts on their Certified User Programmer exam which will allow me to show off some kind of proof that I did some game development work, even though it isn't paid. I plan to take one of those exams in mid May.

Also, I decided to do something that I have rarely done, and start to learn how to do 3D modeling with ZBrush software. Hopefully I will have a use for the Wacom Intuos Pro tablet that I have had little chance to use when I had my non-artist related job.

## Next steps?

Since I am more likely going to hope to get some freelance online work, I am going to lean toward doing a bit of game programming.

I will plan to finish the Create with Code Live course track in May and take the exam, and publish a very simple 3D game I did using that course track. The game can be published online (Unity has WebGL module). Depending how I do with learning the Unity game engine, I may try to do a similar simple game with the Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine, however, is a very different beast than Unity, with a somewhat higher learning curve than Unity, though if you are working as a dev teammember or if you are going to work on a major console or PC title, you will use Unreal or an engine similar to Unreal.

Also, I am going to research Gnomon Workshop and see what they offer. No, I do not think I will plan to go to the Gnomon School - not yet, anyway. Someday.
