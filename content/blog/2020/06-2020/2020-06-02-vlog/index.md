## Vlogging

The popularity of people doing vlogging (basically you film yourself in life) has really caught on and I'm now contemplating whether to do one.

The videos are not going to be hosted here on this site (it will put me in a paid tier on Netlify if I do), so I will more than likely pipe them through YouTube for exposure.

But I have to figure out what I should do and make this vlog work. I had considered doing vlogging a year or so ago but I never got around to do it as I felt it would be expensive.

I have a camera that's somewhat easy to carry, but it's a Panasonic G9, so it won't be quite as discreet and I'll have to figure out if I should just get an attachment for a smartphone and a small tripod.

I could try using my drones again... but the only drone that would be suitable for personal stuff is the Spark, which DJI has since replaced with the Mavic Mini (I do own a Mavic 2 Pro but it is too big to use as a recreational personal drone) and I will be looking into replacing the Spark with the Mavic Mini.

## But...where to vlog?

That's the most important part. In my times with photography, you need a serious travel budget, and you need a travel mate - and unfortunately, I need a travel mate / date (it's hard to find one these days), so I have to do ones where I can go around in the city alone. At the time of this posting, however, a curfew has been imposed in LA County due to the George Floyd protests, so I will have to wait for the curfew to go away.

Where could I go? It's still quarantine season as I speak.

I probably will just do in home stuff, and then I'll focus on what to do later in 2021. In 2021, I plan to travel, and I will be looking at going to Japan.

Stay tuned for when my first vlogs will start, though, while I'm in SoCal.
