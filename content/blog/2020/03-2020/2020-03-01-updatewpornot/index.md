## Previous blog 

Not many know, but I maintained an earlier blogroll website, before losing interest in it. The website was maintained on darkwingotaku.wordpress.com. I had that blogsite for almost 7 years and initially was a continuation of a blogroll site I had on Blogger and Xanga from back in the days before Blogger was acquired by Google and Xanga still was relevant.

The last posting was in 2017.

From there I was not able to move on from 2017. I lost interest in blogging and "video blogging" started to become more effort and money than I had thought, so I wound up not doing any blogs - until now.

As of this post, I still have the WordPress site active but I have not update the site since then, and I have moved to this site I set up with Netlify as a hosting service. I plan to prune some of the posts I made from my WP site and move them here. I have not considered yet whether to close my WP blogroll site forever.
